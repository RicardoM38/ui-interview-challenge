## UI Designer Exercise

This exercise is intended to see how you think and what types of design styles and patterns you would use 
if you were selected to work at Living As One. 

### User Story Definition

As a user of our system, I want to be able to visualize viewer metrics for an Event over a given time period.  The product Marketing team has provided you the Mockup (ControlAnalytics.htm) given our current Portal design.  However, they have told you that we are going to rebuild our portal from scratch soon so the design will only be limited by your creativity.
